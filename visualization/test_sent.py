         "find the Sim reader and vibration motor. which Apple calls the taptic engine. next to come out is the " \
         "battery a. consumable item that will eventually. need replacement no matter how you treat. your phone Apple " \
         "has included two. stretch release tabs but they are. cramped between the battery and a metal. wall. given " \
         "the lack of space I'll wrap the. adhesive around my tweezers and pull it. out from beneath the battery " \
         "it's. important that you don't catch the. adjacent cable and tear it while doing. this. foreign. well it " \
         "looked like I got both tabs out. it appears they snapped at the bottom. which usually happens so it's time " \
         "for. some alcohol to break down the remaining. adhesive. once it's done its job I can pry out the. battery. " \
         "this. 3279 milliamp hour battery is ever so. slightly larger than the 3200 milliamp. hour battery found in " \
         "the iPhone 14 pro. with the battery out we're left with a. mid frame consisting of just a charging. port " \
         "speaker and some buttons. with that we've taken apart the iPhone. 14. it's proven vastly different to the. " \
         "insides of the iPhone 14 pro and even. the iPhone 13 it replaced apple is still. using four different types " \
         "of screws and. continues locking down third-party. repair but the ability to replace the. back glass is " \
         "still an improvement. now it's come time to reassemble both. phones. I often see comments about how " \
         "someone. doesn't want third-party repair or. wouldn't take their device anywhere else. but the manufacturer " \
         "and that's their. choice choice is what right to repair. fights for it's not about forcing people. into " \
         "fixing their own device or. preventing you from taking it to the. manufacturer to have it fixed it's about. " \
         "taking back control of something you. purchased I understand not all third. party repair is done correctly " \
         "but if. you want to take the risk or save money. that should be your choice. the repair history Apple is " \
         "implemented. in settings is actually useful to. second-hand buyers but it shouldn't. disable functionality " \
         "and make it look. as though the replacement part is faulty. that's the big issue I'm trying to. highlight. " \
         "for reinstalling the battery I've. modified an iPhone 6s adhesive to fit. there's currently not any " \
         "replacement. adhesive available so I've had to make. do with what I have. once installed I can attach the " \
         "front. cameras before plugging in the front. display. each bracket latches in place on one. side and is " \
         "secured with a screw on the. opposite end. I'll wipe down the inside to remove any. fingerprints or dust " \
         "before closing up. the display I haven't applied any new. adhesive as just like the battery it's. not yet " \
         "available. I'll connect the rear panel and fasten. its bracket into place after. reconnecting the battery " \
         "there's one. more bracket and two screws before I can. clean off the insides and seal down the. rear cover. " \
         "I'll reinstall the SIM card tray and the. two pentalobe screws on the bottom. and we're almost done there's " \
         "still one. more phone left to reassemble thankfully. I've kept track of all the screws and. correct parts " \
         "for each phone meaning we. shouldn't have any issues after both. phones are back together. after closing up " \
         "the rear panel and. installing the two pentalobe screws into. the bottom of the iPhone. we're done. so this " \
         "is it the iPhone 14. despite its. more modular design it still houses the. same anti-third party repair " \
         "mechanisms. as the iPhone 14 pro after reassembly. auto brightness true tone and battery. health have " \
         "returned but I'm still. getting a face ID error like I mentioned. before I'll need to reset the phone with. " \
         "iTunes to fix that issue it should be. noted that face ID will only return if. the module is the original " \
         "one. breaking down all the anti-third party. repair locks replacing your display will. remove true tone and " \
         "Brake auto. brightness a new battery will disable. battery health a new front camera will. break face ID " \
         "portrait mode and. cinematic mode a rear camera will only. give you a warning message and lastly. replacing " \
